# [angular-messages-bus]

This project defines a messages bus for AngularJS applications.
The usual use case is to dispatch events between several AngularJS controllers.

For example: One can publish an event to the bus and every controllers interested in it are notified and can also react accordingly...
  
## Install
  
### Using Bower
  
 ``` bash
 bower install angular-messages-bus
 ```
## Quick start

+ Include messagesBus.js in your Cordova application. Please note that this library is using jquery internally. So you need to include it in your application.

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/messagesBus.js"></script>
```

or use the minified version:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/messagesBus.min.js"></script>
```

+ Add the module `messageBusModule` as a dependency to your app module:

```javascript
var myapp = angular.module('myapp', ['messageBusModule']);
```

+ Use the messagesBusService as controller dependency and call messagesBusService API:

Several steps need to be followed to make the dream come true!

### Registering subscriber to a specific event

The first thing you need to do is to register a subscriber to a specific event.
The subscriber will be called once the event it is registered will be dispatched.

**The subscriber needs to be composed at least of:**
+ a name that identifies it uniquely
+ a handler: a function that will be called once the event will be raised. The function has a parameter that is provided during the event publishing call...

```javascript

    // Define a subscriber
    var subscriber = {
        name: 'event-subscriber',
        handler: function (data) {
            $scope.result = data;
        }
    };

    // Register the subscriber to the event named 'event'
    messagesBusService.register('event', subscriber);
};
```

### Dispatching the event

Once the subscriber has been successfully registered to the event, invoking it is a breeze!
The `messageBusService` comes with the `publish` method which allow to make the job done...

```javascript

    // Publishing event (this will cause all the event subscribers to be invoked on their handler function)
    messagesBusService.publish('event', { msg: 'Hello World!' });
};
```

The second parameter constains arbitrary data which will be transmited to each subscribers.

A quick sample:

```javascript
$scope.result = 'nothing received yet...';

$scope.testSubscription = function() {
    // Define the subscriber
    var subscriber = {
        name: 'event-subscriber',
        handler: function (data) {
            // Store the given data in scope: { msg: 'Hello World!' }
            $scope.result = data;
        }
    };

    // Register it
    messagesBusService.register('event', subscriber);
    
    // Dispatch the event ($scope.result will change)
    messagesBusService.publish('event', { msg: 'Hello World!' });
};
```
